# Electrostatic-FEM
A python implementation of the Finite-Element-Method (FEM) to solve the electrostatic laplace equation in a rectangular box with metal walls. One of the walls has its voltage set to 1V while the others are set to 0V. This is based on the method outlined by "Introduction to the Finite Element
Method in Electromagnetics" by Anastasis C. Polycarpou.
